Installing and Building *vcnc-server*
-------------------------------------

*vcnc-server* has two build procedures.  The *internal* process works with artifacts
generated by building PeerCache from source. The *external* process works
with libraries and software obtained from a PeerCache product distribution.

Refer to :ref:`vcnc_server_internal_build` when building *vcnc-server* to be compatible with
a PeerCache development build. Refer to :ref:`vcnc_server_external_build` when building vCNC
to be compatible with a PeerCache product release.
