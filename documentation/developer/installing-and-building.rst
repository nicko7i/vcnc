Installing and Building
=======================

vCNC has two build processes.  The *internal* process works with artifacts
generated by building PeerCache from source. The *external* process works
with libraries and software obtained from a PeerCache product distribution.

Refer to :ref:`external_build` when building vCNC to be compatible with a PeerCache development
build. Refer to :ref:`internal_build` when building vCNC to be compatible with a PeerCache
product release.
