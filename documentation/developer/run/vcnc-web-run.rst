Running *vcnc-web*
==================

The following command will run a Node server in the foreground
and spawn a browser page that loads and displays the software.

.. code-block:: console

  cd vcnc-web
  npm start

As a development build, it is running a lot of validation
software in the background.  It's perfectly functional, but
will not have the production level of performance.
