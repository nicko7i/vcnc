Release 3.4.2

	Added 'vtrq_id' to the 'grid job' POST request body.

	Remove supurious output from 'vsh'

	vclc uses new-style workspace specifications. Set VELSTOR_VCLC_COMPAT=1
	to get old-style.

	New 'vclc grid list' command.

	New 'vgrid --list' option.

Release 3.4.0

	The 'grid jobs' clients: vsh and vgrid

	Changed the default vCNC port to its new value.

	<B4998> Fixed exception thrown when trqid or vcnc host is
	unspecified.

Release 3.3.2

	Fixed the ETIME message from vclc ns mkdir ...

Release 3.3.1

	<FRQU-119> Corrected description of --overwrite. Again.

	Pretty-print JSON output

	<FRQU-119> Corrected description of --overwrite.

Release 3.2.6

	API is 202/fulfill asynchronous protocol aware.

	vCLC is fully synchronous against the vCNC.

Release 3.2.5

	existing web server or a non-existent machine/port.

	Syntax errors in 'vclc ws set' JSON are reported by line and
	column.

	<FRQU-89> 'ws set' invalid JSON prints a descriptive error message
	with line and column references.

Release 3.2.2
	Removed debug logging that was polluting stdout.

	Added a --debug option that logs HTTP activity to stderr.

Release 3.2.1
	<B5413> Fixed the continual ENOENT in 'vp find'.

	Re-structured the install directory tree so that the vclc release
	can be copied on top of a velstor release for unified packaging.

	Fixed the missing build number in 'vclc --version'

Release 3.2.0
	Changed the syntax of 'vp find' to make all the search criteria
	optional.  This matches the way the vCNC REST API works.

	Changed the default port to 5500 from 9080

	Automated test that exercises every command except 'shutdown'

	In the help, mention that 'vp delete' is a future feature.

	Fixed bugs created due to refactoring errors.

Release 3.0.0
	Reflects VelStor branding all the way down.  Must be used against
	a velstorized vCNC

Release 2.3.0
	Added vp commands 'clc vp get', 'clc vp find' and 'clc vp delete'

Release 2.2.1

	Fixed various crashes due to recent code refactoring.

	Make the --json flag toggle a boolean.  Has no effect today;
	scripts should specify --json for forward compatibility.

	Increase the timeout on potentially long operations to 24
	hours. This is a temporary measure until true HTPP asynchronous
	handling can be implemented.

	Increse the timeout on 'ns ls' to 5s from 1s.

	CLC output is true JSON rather than a Python dict representation.

Release 2.2.0:

	Correct the help message for 'clc ns ls' to indicate that only
	directories can be listed.

	Suggest checking environment and command line switches if clc
	fails to connect to the default CNC host:port value.  In any case,
	present a friendlier message when the CNC doesn't respond at all.

	The 'ns ls' command has a short (1 sec) connection timeout.
	Eventually, all the commands will have a configurable timeout, but
	in the meantime 'clc ns ls /' can be used for testing.

	Fix <B9705>: exception on valid meta-data copy.

Release 2.1.0:
	Recursive delete option for namespace deletes.

	Additional short-form options for most operations.

Release 2.0.0:

	Write informational messages and unstructured error messages to
	stderr.  stdout is reserved for automated parsing.

	--help provides information about option default values and
	environment variables.

Release 1.0.1:
	Rebuilt with CPython bundled

Release 1.0.0:
	Initial release.
