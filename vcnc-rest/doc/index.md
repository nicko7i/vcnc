# vCNC Server Documentation

The vCNC provides a REST-style API for the use of administrative clients,
other PeerCache components, and customer-developed software.

The [Interactive API Explorer](/v2/doc/api/?url=spec) is both the formal API specification
and an interactive REST client.

We are currently at version 2 of the API.  Looking for version 1? You can find
it [here](/v1/doc/api/?url=spec).

Complete documentation is available on [GitHub](https://nicko7i.github.io/vcnc)
