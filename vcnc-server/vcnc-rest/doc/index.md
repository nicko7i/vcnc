# vCNC Server Documentation

The vCNC provides a REST-style API for the use of administrative clients,
other PeerCache components, and customer-developed software.

The [Interactive API Explorer](/v1a/doc/api/?url=spec) is both the formal API specification
and an interactive REST client.

This software features [version 1a](/v1a/doc/api/?url=spec) of the API, with delegation "trickle" features. .  Looking for plain version 1? You can find
it [here](/v1/doc/api/?url=spec).
